# Automated Scanning with Phish Tool

For additional insights, I uploaded the email to Phish Tool, a web-based phishing analysis tool. The automated scan flagged two issues:

DKIM Signatures: Inconsistencies with the DKIM signature added to the suspicion.
Sender Information: Mismatches in the senderâ€™s details, which corroborate the findings from the manual analysis.
