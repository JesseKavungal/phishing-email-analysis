# Summary of Findings

The analysis identified multiple indicators of phishing, including:

**Sender Information Mismatch:** The claimed sender information does not match the actual email address, hinting at spoofing.

**Urgency in Subject and Content:** Phishing emails often use urgency to prompt action.

**Base64 Encoding:** Obfuscated link, which, when decoded, leads to a fake  login page.

**Failed DKIM Signatures:** Indicates possible tampering or unauthorized use of the domain.

**URL Reputation:** The URL has a history of malicious activity, confirmed by URLScan.io and VirusTotal.

Based on these findings, this email is highly likely to be a phishing attempt designed to steal credentials by impersonating a trusted source.
