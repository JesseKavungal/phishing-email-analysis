# URL Analysis

I analyzed the decoded URL using URLScan.io and VirusTotal to verify its reputation and history. The results revealed that:

The URL had been previously flagged in phishing campaigns.
The page itself is currently inactive, but it had a history of being used maliciously in phishing attempts.
This analysis confirmed that the URL was likely used to gather credentials fraudulently.
