# Sender IP Analysis

Using EIOC.py, I extracted the IP addresses from the headers. 
These were then cross-referenced with WhatIsMyIPAddress.com (IP Lookup).

The IP was associated with a legitimate Microsoft server:
Hostname: mail-am6eur05on2060.outbound.protection.outlook.com
ISP: Microsoft Corporation
Although the IP address aligns with Microsoft, the spoofed domain in the "From" field suggests that the email could be forged.
