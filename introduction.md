# Introduction

The purpose of this project is to provide a comprehensive, step-by-step guide on analyzing suspicious emails to identify phishing indicators and confirm any malicious intent. 
By documenting the entire process, this guide aims to assist security analysts and enthusiasts in conducting email phishing analysis systematically. 
This document will showcase the tools and techniques used in  phishing detection, detailing each method from header analysis to content decoding. 
The goal is to equip readers with the skills to recognize common signs of phishing and to analyze emails accurately.

In this project, I utilized various tools for different aspects of the analysis, including manual inspection of email headers, automated phishing scans, and URL reputation checks. 
Each tool contributed to identifying different phishing indicators, from IP address mismatches to unverified email domains and encoded malicious links.
